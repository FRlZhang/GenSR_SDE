# Project Status

## Current Goal

Improve sequence-level SDE recovery after establishing that the current unified fingerprint and role-token target are learnable by GenSR. The immediate next step is diverse candidate generation plus SDE fingerprint-distance reranking, not another fingerprint redesign.

## Completed

- Added unified SDE fingerprint pipeline in `sde_fingerprint.py`.
- Added autonomous 1D SDE simulation helpers in `simulator_sde.py`.
- Added GenSR-compatible SDE dataset generation in `sde_dataset_generator.py`.
- Patched `train.py` to inject SDE samples through `EnvDataset.generate_sample`, correcting the earlier invalid `env.generate_sample` hook.
- Added `<DRIFT>` and `<DIFFUSION>` to the equation vocabulary.
- Added `sde_validation_probe.py` as the main fast train/eval/decoding harness.
- Added checkpoint save/load/eval-only support.
- Ran a 2000-step role-token probe with:

```text
token_top1=0.820002
token_top3=0.960833
token_top5=1.000000
greedy_sequence_exact=0.015625
```

- Ran constrained-beam eval from the same checkpoint; exact recovery improved only slightly (`1/32` on a 32-sample eval).

## In Progress

- Transitioning from token recognition to full symbolic sequence recovery.
- Preparing candidate generation and reranking by SDE fingerprint distance.

## Next Steps

1. Implement diverse candidate generation in `sde_validation_probe.py`.
2. Convert each valid candidate into drift/diffusion expressions.
3. Recompute or approximate its SDE fingerprint.
4. Rerank candidates by distance to the target fingerprint.
5. Compare greedy, constrained beam, and reranked candidate metrics on the same held-out setup.

## Open Questions

- Should reranking use full unified fingerprint distance, componentwise distance, or short-time conditional moments?
- Should candidates be generated jointly as `<DRIFT> ... <DIFFUSION> ...`, or separately for drift/diffusion and paired later?
- How much error is decoder search versus template ambiguity?
- How well will current fingerprints transfer to real observed SDE data without multiple initial conditions?

## Known Issues

- Sequence-level recovery is weak even when teacher-forced token accuracy is strong.
- Grammar-constrained beam enforces validity better than correctness.
- The best checkpoint is outside the repo and may disappear.
- `environment.yml` is upstream/Linux-oriented; recent work used the local macOS `gensr` conda env.
