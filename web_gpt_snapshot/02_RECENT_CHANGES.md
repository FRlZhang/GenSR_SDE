# Recent Changes

## Last Codex Workflow

Codex performed handoff-system cleanup:

- added `web_gpt_handoff/` to `.gitignore` so the bulky temporary handoff package
  stays local and is not committed;
- kept `web_gpt_snapshot/` as the stable lightweight Web GPT snapshot directory
  intended for commit;
- preserved the rule that future project-state changes update the fixed snapshot
  files instead of generating many new handoff files.

No Python source, commands, checkpoints, experiment metrics, or model behavior
changed.

## Previous Codex Workflow

Codex updated `AGENTS.md` with a new Web GPT Snapshot Rule:

- after any Codex workflow that changes project state, update
  `web_gpt_snapshot/02_RECENT_CHANGES.md` and
  `web_gpt_snapshot/03_CURRENT_TASK.md`;
- update `01_PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `04_COMMANDS.md`, and `00_WEB_GPT_INDEX.md`
  only when their respective content actually changes;
- keep fixed small snapshot files stable for manual replacement in ChatGPT Web
  Project Sources;
- do not copy datasets, checkpoints, dumps, weights, `.git/`, caches, or full
  `symbolicregression/` into the snapshot.

This update also refreshed this file and `03_CURRENT_TASK.md`. No Python source,
commands, checkpoints, or experiment metrics changed.

## Previous Codex Workflow

Codex cleaned the git chain and committed the SDE role-token validation state:

```text
4affb88 Add role-token SDE validation probe
```

That commit added/updated:

- `sde_validation_probe.py`: fast SDE train/eval harness with checkpoint save/load/eval-only and constrained beam.
- `sde_dataset_generator.py`: role-token target format and split drift/diffusion encodings.
- `symbolicregression/envs/environment.py`: added `<DRIFT>` and `<DIFFUSION>` tokens.
- `symbolicregression/trainer_vae.py`: optional split SDE loss path and CPU-safe `to_cuda`.
- `train.py`: corrected SDE sample injection through `EnvDataset.generate_sample`.
- `README.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `SDE_TRAINING_REPORT.md`, `AGENTS.md`: recovery docs and experiment state.

Codex then generated an older, fuller handoff directory:

```text
web_gpt_handoff/
```

The current request creates this lighter long-term snapshot:

```text
web_gpt_snapshot/
```

## Git Status Before This Rule Update

```text
?? web_gpt_handoff/
?? web_gpt_snapshot/
```

There was no tracked source diff before updating `AGENTS.md` and the snapshot
notes.

## Recent Diff Summary

- Tracked documentation change: `AGENTS.md` now includes the Web GPT Snapshot
  Rule.
- Snapshot notes updated in `web_gpt_snapshot/02_RECENT_CHANGES.md` and
  `web_gpt_snapshot/03_CURRENT_TASK.md`.
- No datasets, checkpoints, weights, dumps, or cache files were added to this snapshot.

## Verification Already Run In Recent Workflow

Passed:

- `py_compile` on edited Python entrypoints.
- `git diff --check`.
- `git diff --cached --check` before the commit.
- 2-step `sde_validation_probe.py` smoke test with checkpoint save and held-out evaluation.

Not rerun during this documentation-only update:

- Full eval-only checkpoint decoding.
- 2000-step retraining.
- Python smoke tests, because no Python source changed.

## Risks / Unfinished Items

- The best checkpoint lives in `/private/tmp` and may be deleted.
- Reranking is not implemented yet.
- Future project-state changes must update `02_RECENT_CHANGES.md` and
  `03_CURRENT_TASK.md`; update other fixed snapshot files only when their
  contents actually change.
